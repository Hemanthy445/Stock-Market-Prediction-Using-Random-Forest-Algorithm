# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Algorithm

Abstract

In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future value of the financial stocks of a company. The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. Machine learning itself employs different models to make prediction easier and authentic. The report focuses on the use of Random forest based model to predict stock values. Factors considered are open, close, low, high and volume. An algorithm with high accuracy we do the process of comparison for the accuracy of each of the model and finally is considered as better algorithm for predicting stock price. As share market is a vague domain we cannot predict the conditions occur, and also share market can never be predicted, this job can be done easily and technically through this work and the main aim of this paper is to apply algorithms in predicting the stock prices.

Overview

Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result. Put simply: random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction. The random forest means data about data estimator. It fits a number decision trees on various sub samples of the given data. It control over-fitting. It improve the predictive accuracy.

Problem Statement

Stock Exchanges are financial institutions which allow transferability of different goods (monetary values, actions, precious metals) between stock broker components. With a turnover of trading around thousands of billions of dollars, this gets people’s eager attention of making a profit. Goods are traded on the market, following their subsequent value to determine if the transaction has generated profit or not. In general the value of a stock is given by its entry on the stock exchange and the volume of its transactions. The more a share is transacted, the more it is valuable, and conversely, if a share is put into transaction in a low volume, it is not so important for some traders and by default its value decreases. This anticipation of the market can generate profits or losses. Depending on the power to predict future values. Therefore the problem becomes: for a given Stock market history, determine the moment of buying/entry or the selling/exit the good for generating profit. An aspect that has attracted researchers is predicting the values of the goods. Thus an algorithm used to train models, namely Random Forest, is used to tackle the problem.

Working of Random Forest Algorithm:

Step 1: From the dataset pick N random records.
Step 2: Based on N records, build a decision tree.
Step 3: From the algorithm, choose the number of trees and repeat steps 1 & 2
Step 4: In case of a regression problem, for a new record, each tree in the forest predicts a value for Y(output)

Result and Analysis:

Random Forest is a great algorithm, for both classification and regression problems, to produce a predictive model. Its default hyperparameters already return great results and the system is great at avoiding overfitting. Moreover, it is a pretty good indicator of the importance it assigns to your features. From this the dataset taken we find the profit respective to various countries. We from the last confusion matrix get the conclusion of profit-profit percentage to be 100%. We analyze and observe that random forest is the best algorithm for classifying giving the best result out of all the trees it finds, the only problem we face is the since the output would be large it takes a lot of time thus increasing the computation time.

Conclusion:

The Random Forest algorithm is one of the most popular machine learning algorithms that is used for both classification and regression. The ability to perform both tasks makes it unique, and enhances its wide-spread usage across a myriad of applications. It also assures high accuracy most of the time, making it one of the most sought-after classification algorithms. Random Forests are comprised of Decision Trees. The more trees it has, the more sophisticated the algorithm is. It selects the best result out of the votes that are pooled by the trees, making it robust.
